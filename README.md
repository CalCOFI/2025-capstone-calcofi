# UCSB 2024-2025 Capstone Project: CalCOFI & California Sea Grant

This project is sponsored by California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), an organization founded in 1949 to study the ecological aspects of the Pacific sardine collapse off of the coast of California. CalCOFI is committed to studying California’s coastal marine environment and collecting relevant oceanographic data in order to provide insight on important climate change related topics such as renewable energy, integrated ocean management, and marine spatial planning.

We aim to extend the research done in “A 37 year record of ocean acidification in the Southern California current” by Wolfe et al. on the yearly rate of change of certain carbonate chemistry variables by examining all available carbonate chemistry data collected across CalCOFI observation stations rather than only surface data collected at station 90.90, and study the impact of ocean acidification on zooplankton and krill biovolumes.
